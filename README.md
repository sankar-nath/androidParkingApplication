This application was created as part of my T440 course at George Brown College.

Here we have a 2 screen Android application that lets users pay for parking.

Screen 1: Pay for Parking Screen

This screen has:1. A form for entering parking information2. A options menu with menu item that displays link to Screen #2

When the PAY NOW button is pressed, the app calculates the cost of parking and output a receipt to the screen. 

Example:RECEIPTParking Lot ALicense Plate: AMHG 100Hours: 3Total Paid: $7.50

Screen 2: History of Receipts
Screen #2 displays the list of purchases from Screen #1 in a recycler view
